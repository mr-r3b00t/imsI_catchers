    <h1>Global Incidents of Criminal Use of IMSI Catchers</h1>
    <p><strong>Report Date:</strong> November 08, 2025</p>
    <p>Based on publicly reported cases up to November 8, 2025, there have been <strong>at least 16 distinct incidents</strong> worldwide involving confirmed or suspected criminal (non-state) deployment of IMSI catchers (including hybrid SMS blasters/rogue base stations) for purposes like smishing, blackmail, or espionage. These are primarily linked to organized fraud syndicates, with concentrations in Southeast Asia and Europe. The tally focuses on incidents with detections, arrests, or convictions; underreporting persists due to the devices' covert nature. No centralized global database exists.</p>

        <h2>Additional Notes (Criminal Use)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trends:</strong> 70%+ involve smishing by vehicle/backpack devices from Asian syndicates; earlier cases focused on espionage/blackmail. Philippines leads with 5 incidents in 2025 due to POGO shutdowns shifting tactics.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Many are low-level operators; leaders often evade via proxies. SMS blasters (IMSI variants) surged in 2025, per Europol/Interpol reports.</li>
            <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Compiled from news, official releases, and analyses; totals may rise with improved detection.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Confirmed Police/Security Services IMSI Catcher Deployments</h2>
    <p>Based on disclosures, FOIA requests, and investigations up to November 8, 2025, there have been <strong>at least 13 documented deployments</strong> by law enforcement or security agencies globally. These are used for tracking suspects, counter-terrorism, and immigration enforcement, often under secrecy agreements. US agencies dominate reports due to ACLU advocacy; European uses face privacy scrutiny. Warrants are required in some jurisdictions (e.g., California), but not all. No global tally exists, but estimates suggest 100+ agencies worldwide.</p>
